# Dojomon

**Dojomon** is an engaging and decentralized 2D top-down pixel multiplayer game inspired by the **Pokemon anime series**, built using the **Dojo Game Engine** on StarkNet. The game merges classic Pokemon-style gameplay with modern blockchain technology to deliver a nostalgic yet innovative experience. Players can explore a dynamic world, catch and train DojoMons, compete in online battles, and maintain farms for resources, all while earning on-chain rewards and climbing competitive leaderboards.

## üåü Project Overview

Dojomon is a **provable game** built entirely using the **Dojo Stack**, a decentralized game engine on StarkNet. The game offers **two main modes**:

1. **Story Mode**: Players embark on a journey to catch DojoMons, battle gym trainers, and become champions of their world.
    
2. **Competitive Mode**: Online multiplayer battles with ranked matchmaking and a league system (from Bronze to Grandmaster), alongside casual matches with friends using lobby codes.
    

Players can also engage in farming systems to grow food, recover their DojoMons' health, and earn coins for purchasing items in an in-game shop. The provable mechanics ensure fairness, ownership, and transparency throughout the game, all powered by StarkNet‚Äôs scalability and security.
